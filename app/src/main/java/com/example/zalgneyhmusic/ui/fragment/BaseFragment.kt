/**
 * Base fragment class that other fragments in the app can extend.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Provides a common parent class for all fragments.
 * - Can be used to define shared logic, utilities, or lifecycle handling
 *   across multiple fragments.
 *
 * Currently, this class does not add custom behavior, but serves as
 * an extension point for future shared functionality.
